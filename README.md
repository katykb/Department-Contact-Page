### Description
      User Story:

      The manager needs to be able to easily contact their employees by email or github.
### Usage
      Quickly contact employees by their email or github. Or in case of an intern, refernce what school they are attending.
### Instructions
      Run "npm i" then in the command line start node with the "node ." or "node filename.js" command.
      Answer all command prompts, you will not be able to proceed if a question is skipped.
      Manager information must first be entered. Once this is completed, you will be prompted to either
